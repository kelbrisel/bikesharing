## Summary

Based on the information gathered from the NYC market, the business is fairly predictable and consistent. In order to assess Iowa location more thoroughly, vizualizations that include a line graph with repairs by bike id to better communicate expected repair costs, and a bar graph of weekday, gender, and usertype would better communicate a view of the overall market.
